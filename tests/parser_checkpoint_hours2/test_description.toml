description = "A series of tests which checkpoint and exit after 30 seconds.  At the beginning of the test, a timestamp file is created. Checking the timestamp on this file (also stored as an integer in the file, as seconds since the epoch) against the timestamp on the checkpoint file should give a reasonable, though not utterly infallible test. This variant has an exit spec and time specified in seconds. This variant has an exit spec and time specified in hours, minutes, and seconds, where only the hourss are positive, and all other values are negative. This should help if the computation of the alarm time is compromised somehow."
