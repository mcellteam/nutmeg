description = "Combination of ALL_MOLECULES with surface properties (REFLECTIVE/TRANSPARENT/ABSORPTIVE). Volume molecules are released inside a set of enclosed meshes. Let some of the meshes be REFLECTIVE, or TRANSPARENT, or ABSORPTIVE. This test check validity of ALL_VOLUME_MOLECULES statement in combination with REFLECTIVE/TRANSPARENT/ABSORPTIVE properties of meshes.The properties of inner cubes change from REFLECTIVE to TRANSPARENT to ABSORPTIVE for ALL_MOLECULES as we move from one collection to another. Volume molecules A,B,C are released inside the inner cube. We count molecules in the space between the cubes."
