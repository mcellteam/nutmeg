description = "Volume molecule + surface reactions, such as those used in absorptive or concentration clamped surfaces, were not properly checking whether any ENCLOSED (or other waypoint-requiring) counts had been requested.  This leads to a seg fault if no other waypoint-requiring features are needed, and some unnecessary computation otherwise. Also here we are testing keywords CLAMP_CONC, ESTIMATE_CONC, DIFFUSION_CONSTANT"
