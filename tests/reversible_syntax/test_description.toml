description = "When parsing bimolecular reaction syntax '<->', MCell did not properly initialize the flag indicating if the product was a complex or not for the reverse reaction pathway. This led to reactions being incorrectly identified as complex resulting in a crash. Thanks a lot to Sabina Hrabetova for bringing this to our attention. This was fixed with commit ID 0eca73ee751"
