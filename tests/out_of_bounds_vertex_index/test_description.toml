description = "This test checks that MCell properly catches out of bounds vertex access in POLYGON_LIST (instead of segfaulting). A check was added to MCell on 07/11 in response to an email to mcell-dev by Namrata Mohapatra. He had a Matlab generated input geometry with out of bounds vertex indices causing MCell to segfault."
