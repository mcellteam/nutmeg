description = "Checkpoint file contains incorrect simulation times. This is a bug encountered by Jacob Czech (2009-01-16).  When a checkpoint file is created, if the time step has been changed between saving and loading the checkpoint, an incorrect \"current time\" is stored into the checkpoint file.  This will not have any immediate adverse effects; if, however, the simulation, after loading from the checkpoint, checkpoints again and reloads, times listed in the reaction data output files will be incorrect!\nFailure: Times jump from 1.5e-6 to 2.2e-6\nSuccess: Times jump from 1.5e-6 to 1.7e-6"
