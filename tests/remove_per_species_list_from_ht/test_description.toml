description = "This is a bug encountered by Shirley Pepke (2008-04-24). When a per-species list is removed from the hash table, if the hash table has a collision for the element being removed, and the element removed was not the first element (i.e. was the element which originally experienced the collision), memory could be corrupted due to a bug in the hash table removal code."
