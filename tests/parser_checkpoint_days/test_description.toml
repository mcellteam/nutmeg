description = "A series of tests which checkpoint and exit after 30 seconds.  At the beginning of the test, a timestamp file is created. Checking the timestamp on this file (also stored as an integer in the file, as seconds since the epoch) against the timestamp on the checkpoint file should give a reasonable, though not utterly infallible test. This variant has an exit spec and time specified in seconds. This variant has an exit spec and time specified in days, hours, minutes, and seconds, with all but the seconds set to 0."
