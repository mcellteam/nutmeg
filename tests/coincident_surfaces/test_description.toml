description = "When two surfaces coincide and one of them is transparent, odd things happen.  Counting, for one, can become confused.  Essentially, the transparent surface may be re-collided in certain cases. Failure: counts go negative, or extremely positive; total count of cannonballs != 500. Success: for entire run, count 122L+122R == 122 == 500  AND for entire run, count r122L+r122R == r122 == 500"
